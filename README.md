## Introduction

Not migrating to Windows 10 for fear of privacy issues, software instabality, potential system-breaking bugs that have yet to be fixed, dislike of the design style of the overall system? Or maybe you just happened to be stuck on Windows 8/8.1 for one reason or another? Not to worry!

This program has been made specifically for Windows 8/8.1, but is also compatible with Windows 7 and Windows 10 (with the right .NET Framework installed). Of course, that is if you compile the code unmodified.

## How this program came to be

The ability or lack thereof to remove saved wireless networks were quite a bane in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, especially if you had changed the SSID, or if you needed to remove a saved network or two for security reasons, or just because you felt like it.

However, as was noted by many, the functions to do so still existed, but only in a command-line interface. However, this was not an easy task for many, especially if they had been using Windows 7 for a long time, or just didn't really like to use the command-line, or just couldn't remember them by heart.

After some research, I had found out most of these commands, but felt like there could be an easier way to do it. And hence the work on this program begun.

## Installation

This was coded in C#, .NET Framework 3.5, with Visual Studio 2010. This repository contains the complete files that constitutes a working version of the program.

![.NET Framework 3.5](https://public-dm2306.files.1drv.com/y3pXtgOa3VAq1KJC17mOmtDEPHusKHAB9-7yuC54hI8Y09iMHkj7cSTqPzm-c2hu7OPOEI-ixow1bGvhOElUZRiFtFmgt8BNExvufrWkuXzyzmYY1WE-v_-1nYVuGdbqrPq/NET-Frmwrk_h_rgb.png?rdrts=142979546)
